RJ Engine - A top down action based customizable game engine

The RJ Engine is a small, but expansive modular 2d game engine that will be used to power a wide genre of games. While initially developed with the 2d action RPG in mind (Zelda:LttP) I wanted to allow the use of "plug and play" modules to appeal to a broad spectrum that will hopefully assist in the generation of a multitude of unique games.

The engine is based in SDL for the time being, but is not written entirely in stone.

Please provide feedback or use the engine for your own devices.
